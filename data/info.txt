Air Pollution (https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/air-pollution)
	Causes
		- Air pollution is most common is larger cities
		  where carbon emissions are the most concentrated.
		- Can also be due to smoke from wildfires or ash from
		  volcanoes
	Effects On Humans
		- Short-term effects: Illnesses such as pneumonia and
		  bronchitis, irritation to nose, throat eyes and/or skin,
		  dizzines and nausea
		- Long-term effects: Heart disease, lung cancer and 
		  respiratory diseases, Some scientists suspect air pollutants 
		  cause birth defects. Nearly 2.5 million people die worldwide 
		  each year from the effects of air pollution
	Effects On Environment
		- Air pollution can directly contaminate the surface
		  of bodies of water and soil, killing crops or reducing
		  yield.
		- Can create acid rain, damaging buidlings and degrades
		  water quality
		- Animals also susceptible to birth defect and lower
		  reproductive rates
		- Contributes to global warming
	Reduction
		- Reducing carbon footprint: taking public transport,
		  riding a bike, recycling yard trimmings instead of
		  bruning them


Poverty (https://www.dumgal.gov.uk/media/23593/Factsheet-Causes-and-Effects-of-Poverty/pdf/0125-20_Causes_and_Effects_of_poverty.pdf?m=637775983227400000)
	Causes

Carbon Emissions (https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change)
	Causes
		- Burning fossil fuels causes a large chunk of global emissions
		- Manufacturing goods
		- Deforestation
		- Using transportation
		- Powering buildings
	Effects
		- Rising temperatures
		- More severe storms
		- Increased drought: climate change is changing water
		  availability, making it more scarcer in more regions
		- Rising ocean
		- Poverty and displacement: floods may sweep away urban
		  slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. Water scarcity
		  may affect crops
		- Not enough food: With the ocean becoming more acidic,
		  marine resources that feed billions of people are at risk
	Reduction
		- Reduce carbon footprint

Deforestation (https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/effects-of/deforestation)
	Effects
		- More than half the world's land-based plans and animals,
		  and three-quarters of all birds, live in and around forests,
		  destroying their habitat
		- Millions of people's homes will be destroyed and lose jobs
		  because they rely on forests for their homes or to make
		  a living
		- Forest loss is the cause of around 10% of global warming
